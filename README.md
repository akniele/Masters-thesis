# Characterizing, classifying and transforming language model distributions

This is my master's thesis project. The aim was to find explainable differences between the probability distributions output by generative language models of differen sizes:

Further, another aim of the project is to use these explainable differences to transform one model's distributions into another model's distributions (or at least to make them more similar):
