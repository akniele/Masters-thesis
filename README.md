# Characterizing, classifying and transforming language model distributions

This is my master's thesis project. The aim is to find explainable differences between the probability distributions output by generative language models of differen sizes:

Further, another aim of the project is to use these explainable differences to transform one model's distributions into another model's distributions (or at least to make them more similar):

The project is still ongoing. I will update the README in the near future.
